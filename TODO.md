# TODOs

1. &#10003; Define the LIonCore M3 as TypeScript types.
2. &#10003; Define the same thing meta-circularly, using those types.
3. &#10003; Implement a syntax checker, specifically: no `unresolved`s in (at most) single-valued references.
    * &#10003; Implement model walker (`flatMap`).
4. &hellip; Implement constraints.
5. &#10003; Implement derived features.
6. Think about how to improve API of M3 w.r.t. containment?
