# TODOs

1. &#10003; Define the LIonCore M3 as TypeScript types.
2. &hellip; Define the same thing meta-circularly, using those types.
3. Implement a syntax checker, specifically: no unresolveds in refs.
    * Implement model walker.
4. Implement constraints.
5. Implement derived features.
6. Think about how to improve API of M3 w.r.t. containment?
